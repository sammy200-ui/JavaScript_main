# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Journey  

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my progress, practice, and projects as I dive into the world of JavaScript.  

## 📋 About the Journey  
I am currently learning JavaScript from **YouTube tutorials** and tackling beginner-to-intermediate concepts. My goal is to build a strong foundation in JavaScript, enhance my problem-solving skills, and create real-world projects.  

## 📚 Learning Roadmap  
1. **Basics of JavaScript**  
   - Variables, Data Types, and Operators  
   - Functions and Scope  
   - Loops and Conditionals  

2. **Intermediate Topics**  
   - Arrays and Objects  
   - ES6+ Features  
   - DOM Manipulation  

3. **Advanced Topics**  
   - Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await)  
   - APIs and Fetch  
   - JavaScript Frameworks (future goal)  

## 🎯 Progress Tracker

## 🛠️ Practice Questions  
I will include practice problems and solutions in this repository to solidify my understanding of concepts.  

## 🌟 Projects  
As I progress, I will work on small projects to apply what I’ve learned. Some ideas include:  
- A to-do list app  
- A simple calculator  
- A weather app using APIs  

## 📌 Goals  
- Learn at least one JavaScript framework/library (e.g., React).  
- Build a portfolio of JavaScript projects.  
- Share my learning experience with others.
